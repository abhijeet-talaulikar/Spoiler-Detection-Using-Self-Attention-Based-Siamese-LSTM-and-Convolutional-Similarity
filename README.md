## Spoiler-Detection-Using-Self-Attention-Based-Siamese-LSTM-and-Convolutional-Similarity

A spoiler is a review or comment about a media product that reveals enough information about the plot to ruin the potential consumer's excitement. In this study, we focused on detecting spoilers in movie reviews on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. Existing research has adopted approaches specific to media channel and dataset to identify these spoiler reviews. We proposed a new method to detect spoilers using a Siamese neural network architecture with self-attention to find position-invariant semantic textual similarity between movie plots and their reviews with a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 71%. This performance can be further boosted by using metadata about users and content.
